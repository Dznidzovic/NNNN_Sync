Pages NIPR Industry Portal Getting Started with PDB Alerts
Analytics
Created by THembree@nipr.com, last updated by KHinson@nipr.com on Aug 26, 2025  35 minute read
The data in NIPR’s Producer Database (PDB) is constantly changing. Producers move, obtain new licenses, or get appointed with new carriers. It's important for companies to be informed of these changes in a timely manner because there may be regulatory requirements or consequences related to these changes.

PDB Alerts notifies you when certain information changes in the PDB.

Use PDB Alerts if your company:

Needs timely notification of changes to the PDB
Is keeping its own database in sync with the Producer Database. 
Your company can get daily alerts on any producer or business entity on your subscription target list. 
Subscriptions define the types of alerts you want to receive. Set up one or more subscriptions and add a target list of producers to begin generating alerts.

To get started, email businessdevelopment@nipr.com and ask to sign up for PDB Alerts. 

What Updates Trigger Alerts?
Daily alerts are generated when changes like the following occur:

Appointment renewal
Appointment status change
Address update
Name change
License status change
Expiration date change
Continuing education status change
RIRS action
NIPR groups this data into 4 categories: Demographics, Licensing, Appointments, and Regulatory Actions (RIRS).
You can filter alerts based on the category if you do not wish to receive all of the data elements.

Refer to the below chart for a complete list of Alert triggers.

Pricing
Pricing is based on the delivery method selection, the number of targeted producers, and your contract rates. The prices below reflect the standard rates. 

Email: Receive a free email each day + $1.30 charge for a full PDB report for each targeted producer with changes when a report is ordered
Web Service or Composite: $1.30 full detail report for initial onboarding of each producer + $0.25 monthly charge for ongoing maintenance via web service access
Tip: Set up and test your alerts for free in the beta environment before moving to the production environment to save unintended costs.
For more information about our beta environment, see Beta Testing Environment

Delivery Methods
Get alerts on targeted producers through one of the following delivery methods:

Email
Receive a free email notification like below when a change is detected

Producer data is retrieved by ordering full PDB Batch reports from the PDB Alerts landing page
Ideal use case: An organization with a relatively small number of producers which are maintained manually and have minimal changes
Benefits:
No coding necessary to receive alerts
Charged only when a target producer’s data changes and a report is ordered
Web Service
Producer data is retrieved via web service
In production, selecting this option enables monthly charges
Ideal use case: A large organization with many (>1000) producers, programming for automated maintenance of constantly changing data
Benefits:
Code a custom solution to automatically keep your database in sync with the PDB
Charged the same monthly rate per producer, regardless of the number of data changes processed
Composite
continue receiving free emails in addition to web service access
Your account Administrator selects the delivery method using the PDB Alerts web application:



Alert schedule
Targets should be added / removed by 9 PM Central to be considered for the next run
Alert data is updated nightly, Monday through Saturday
Updated reports are available for download by 10:00 AM Central 
Processing usually begins around 4 AM Central. Most runs are complete by 7 AM Central
Could be delayed if the nightly processing is delayed
If not complete by 10 AM, a notice will be posted at Reported production and beta issues
If not complete by 11 PM, alerts will be processed in the next run
Weekends and Holidays
Changes that occur Saturday and Sunday evening are included in Monday's alerts
NIPR does not normally process incoming state data when our offices are closed therefore it is typical to have no alerts the day after a holiday
Despite the schedule, web service users are advised to call the service every day to confirm nothing is missed
The service response will specify whether a new alert file is expected that day and is still in progress, or if there are no alerts scheduled for the day
Exceptions will be posted at NIPR product and state licensing updates
Web Service Process Overview
The following information is a high-level overview of how PDB Alerts work. For more details about how to use PDB Alerts, see Web Service Technical Information. 



Initial Setup
Work with your NIPR Account Coordinator to set up user accounts and assign PDB Alerts roles
The admin for your company selects a Delivery Method
Subscription Setup
Give the subscription a name and contact email address
Select the categories to monitor
Select state filters
Select company affiliation filters
Producer Onboarding
Obtain a baseline of PDB data for the producer one time ($1.30 per producer) using either
Batch report
Recommended for the initial load

Detail report (entityInfo API call)

Recommended for daily onboarding of new producers

Add Targets to the Subscription Target List ($0.25 per producer per month) the same day to avoid gaps in monitoring

The recommended maximum number of targets for one subscription is 10K
Group targets into as few subscriptions as possible
Input options: NPN, FEIN, or SSN + Last Name
During the Alerts processing, NIPR records the run date, NPN, category, state, and branch that changed

Daily Maintenance

Retrieve Alerts Reports Daily for each subscription

Compare New Data to Previous Data

Load New Data

Trigger other business processes

Recovering from missed Alerts
Alerts reports can be backdated up to 14 days if a report is missed
Alerts will always provide current data so it is OK if reports are retrieved and processed out of order
For example:

Timeline

Day 1

Day 2

Day 3

Action

Report is Missed

Retrieve Day 2

Retrieve Day 3 & Day 1

NPN 1

License status is updated to "Expired"

Same license is reinstated back to "Active" status

No Changes

Change was not captured Day 1

The change is processed, updating the license with "Active" status and the new expiration date

When processing Day 1, receive the same license info a second time, showing the most recent (Active) status

NPN 2

New license added

No Changes

No Changes

Change was not captured Day 1


When processing Day 1, receive information about this new license

NPN 3

No Changes

No Changes

License is updated



Change is captured with Day 3 updates
No updates for this NPN when processing Day 1


Web Service Technical Information
In order to begin scoping out the programming effort for implementing PDB Alerts, it is recommended that developers download the WSDL (Web Service Definition Language) and generate a code stub first:

WSDL URLs:

Scope of data in the XML
Alerts reports are generated live upon request for producers with changes on the requested alerts run date
They include the producer's current data for the state, category, and branch that changed
Producer data is keyed back to the producer's NPN

When a change occurs to the PDB data, the Alerts XML returns all related information for that state. For example: 

Any change to an appointment brings back all appointment data for that state.
Any change to a license brings back all license data for that state.
Any change to demographics or contact information brings back all demographic and contact data for that state.
Any change to RIRS actions brings back all RIRS data from that state.
Deleted Licensing and Appointment Information
When all License or Appointment information is deleted from the PDB for a producer in a state for a given branch (JurisdictionReportItem), Alerts are triggered and the Licensing Report from the PDB Alerts Web Service XML will return a set of tags for that branch. When Demographic information is deleted in this same manner, Alerts will also trigger for this event and an empty tag is returned. RIRS deletions do not trigger Alerts.

 For deleted Appointments or Terminations, we will write the following empty tags:

Deleted Appt/Terms Response Example Collapse source


<InsuranceAppointment>
 <StateOrProvinceCode></StateOrProvinceCode>
 <InsurerReferences></InsurerReferences>
 <LicenseeReferences></LicenseeReferences>
</InsuranceAppointment> 


NOTE: These empty tags will only appear in situations where ALL appointments or terminations have been deleted within a branch but will not appear if at least one appointment or termination was not deleted. If an empty tag is present for a branch and other branches aren't displayed, no updates were made to records under the other branches.

Example 1: There are three appointments in the data for a producer on day 1. One of the three appointments is deleted. On day 2, the two remaining appointments will return in the Alerts data for that state and no empty tags will be returned for the deleted appointment for that state.

Example 2: There are three appointments in the data for a producer under branch 1 and three appointments for a producer under branch 2. One appointment is deleted under branch 1. No changes are made to appointments under branch 2. On day 2, the two remaining appointments under branch 1 will return in the Alerts data for that state. No appointment records will display for branch 2 and no empty tags will be returned for the deleted appointment for that state.

Example 3: There is one appointment in the data for a producer under branch 1 and one appointment for a producer under branch 2. The appointment under branch 1 is deleted. On day 2, the empty tag will display under branch 1. No license records will display for branch 2.

For deleted Licenses, we will write the following tags:

Deleted Licenses Response Example Collapse source


<InsuranceLicense>
 <TypeCode>Producer</TypeCode>
</InsuranceLicense> 


NOTE: These tags will only appear in situations where ALL licenses have been deleted for a branch but will not appear if at least one license the producer held was not deleted. The TypeCode of “Producer” will display regardless of what types of licenses were deleted. If this tag is present for a branch and other branches aren't displayed, no updates were made to records under the other branches.

Example 1: There are two licenses in the data for a producer on day 1. One of the two licenses is deleted. On day 2, the remaining license will return in the Alerts data for that state and no tags will be returned for the deleted license for that state.

Example 2: There are three licenses in the data for a producer under branch 1 and three licenses for a producer under branch 2. One license is deleted under branch 1. No changes are made to licenses under branch 2. On day 2, the two remaining licenses under branch 1 will return in the Alerts data for that state. No license records will display for branch 2 and no tags will be returned for the deleted license for that state.

Example 3: There is one license in the data for a producer under branch 1 and one license for a producer under branch 2. The license under branch 1 is deleted. On day 2, the tag will display under branch 1. No license records will display for branch 2.

Key References and Relationships
When it comes to Key References and Relationships, there are a few important things to remember:

As part of the defined XML structure, many wrapper tags have a “key” attribute.
This “key” attribute is similar to the idea of a primary key in a database table.
When the “key” attribute is defined in a wrapper tag for a particular aggregate piece of data, the full description of the data is contained within that aggregate tag.
For instance, a licensee’s appointment has a reference that points back to the person object that contains the real business data about the person. Every time the person is referenced, a key is used to reference the original object that contains all of the aggregate data about the person rather than repeating the aggregate data multiple times over.

Data normalization in XML is done for the same reason that you do data normalization in a database. Whenever you have the same data stored in multiple places you run the risk of introducing data integrity errors.

PDB data is comprised of data supplied by many states. NIPR aggregates the data while maintaining record of which states supplied the data.

PersonPRI Key – The primary key for an individual
OrgPRI Key – The primary key for an organization
State Key – The state demographic record
For example, 1 organization may have 3 different names reported to PDB by 3 different states. The state demographic record would indicate which state supplied each name, as well as other information from that state such as state company ID, branch ID, addresses, etc. All 3 state demographic records would tie back to the organization’s OrgPRI key, which holds the NPN.

It is possible for the same entity to have multiple state key nodes for the same state, if they have changes to multiple branch licenses
